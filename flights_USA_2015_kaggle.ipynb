It could be because it has a very large fleet, it operates low range flights or both. Both are indicators of a Low Cost company strategy, I think Southwest Airlines is a low-cost operator, I will look for it later.\n\nAs we can see in the heatmap and the previous plot, Southwest Airlines is the largest Airline in volume of flights. Until July, the second largest company was Delata Air Lines, but from July its flight operations number is quite similar to American Airlines, which reinforces my hipothesis of its merging with US Airways.",
